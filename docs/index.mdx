# Welcome to go_router!

The goal of the [go_router package](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) is to
simplify use of [the `Router` in
Flutter](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Router-class.html) as specified
by [the `MaterialApp.router`
constructor](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialApp/MaterialApp.router.html).
By default, it requires an implementation of the
[`RouterDelegate`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RouterDelegate-class.html)
and
[`RouteInformationParser`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/RouteInformationParser-class.html)
classes. These two implementations themselves imply the definition of a third
type to hold the app state that drives the creation of the
[`Navigator`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator-class.html). You
can read [an excellent blog post on these requirements on
Medium](https://medium.com/flutter/learning-flutters-new-navigation-and-routing-system-7c9068155ade).
This separation of responsibilities allows the Flutter developer to implement a
number of routing and navigation policies, including deep and dynamic linking,
but at the cost of
[complexity](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlutterDev/comments/koxx4w/why_navigator_20_sucks/).

The purpose of the go_router is to use declarative routes to reduce complexity,
regardless of the platform you're targeting (mobile, web, desktop), handling
deep and dynamic linking from Android, iOS and the web, along with a number of
other navigation-related scenarios, while still (hopefully) providing an
easy-to-use developer experience.
