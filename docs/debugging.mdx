# Debugging Your Routes

Because go_router asks that you provide a set of paths, sometimes as fragments
to match just part of a location, it's hard to know just what routes you have in
your app. In those cases, it's handy to be able to see the full paths of the
routes you've created as a debugging tool, e.g.

```text
GoRouter: known full paths for routes:
GoRouter:   => /
GoRouter:   =>   /family/:fid
GoRouter:   =>     /family/:fid/person/:pid
GoRouter: known full paths for route names:
GoRouter:   home => /
GoRouter:   family => /family/:fid
GoRouter:   person => /family/:fid/person/:pid
```

Likewise, there are multiple ways to navigate, e.g. `context.go()`,
`context.goNamed()`, `context.push()`, `context.pushNamed()`, the `Link` widget,
etc., as well as redirection, so it's handy to be able to see how that's going
under the covers, e.g.

```text
GoRouter: setting initial location /
GoRouter: location changed to /
GoRouter: getting location for name: "person", params: {fid: f2, pid: p1}
GoRouter: going to /family/f2/person/p1
GoRouter: location changed to /family/f2/person/p1
```

Finally, if there's an exception in your routing, you'll see that in the debug
output, too, e.g.

```text
GoRouter: Exception: no routes for location: /foobarquux
```

To enable this kind of output when your `GoRouter` is first created, you can use
the `debugLogDiagnostics` argument:

```dart
final _router = GoRouter(
  routes: ...,
  errorPageBuilder: ...,

  // log diagnostic info for your routes
  debugLogDiagnostics: true,
);
```

This parameter defaults to `false`, which produces no output.
