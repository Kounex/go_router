# Custom Transitions

As you transition between routes, you get transitions based on whether
you're using `MaterialPage` or `CupertinoPage`; each of them implements the
transitions as defined by the underlying platform. However, if you'd like to
implement a custom transition, you can do so by using the `CustomTransitionPage`
provided with go_router:

```dart
GoRoute(
  path: '/fade',
  pageBuilder: (context, state) => CustomTransitionPage<void>(
    key: state.pageKey,
    child: const TransitionsPage(kind: 'fade', color: Colors.red),
    transitionsBuilder: (context, animation, secondaryAnimation, child) =>
        FadeTransition(opacity: animation, child: child),
  ),
),
```

The `transitionBuilder` argument to the `CustomTransitionPage` is called when
you're routing to a new route, and it's your chance to return a transition
widget. The [transitions
sample](https://github.com/csells/go_router/blob/master/example/lib/transitions.dart)
shows off four different kind of transitions, but really you can do whatever you
want.

The `CustomTransitionPage` constructor also takes a `transitionsDuration`
argument in case you'd like to customize the duration of the transition as well
(it defaults to 300ms).
