# Async Data

Sometimes you'll want to load data asynchronously, and you'll need to wait for
the data before showing content. Flutter provides a way to do this with the
`FutureBuilder` widget that works just the same with the go_router as it always
does in Flutter. For example, imagine you've got a `Repository` class that does
network communication when it looks up data:

```dart
class Repository {
  Future<List<Family>> getFamilies() async { /* network comm */ }
  Future<Family> getFamily(String fid) async => { /* network comm */ }
  ...
}
```

Now you can use the `FutureBuilder` to show a loading indicator while the data
is loading:

```dart
class App extends StatelessWidget {
  final repo = Repository();
  ...
  late final _router = GoRouter(
    routes: [
      GoRoute(
        path: '/',
        pageBuilder: (context, state) => NoTransitionPage<void>(
          key: state.pageKey,
          child: FutureBuilder<List<Family>>(
            future: repo.getFamilies(),
            pageBuilder: (context, snapshot) {
              if (snapshot.hasError)
                return ErrorPage(snapshot.error as Exception?);
              if (snapshot.hasData) return HomePage(families: snapshot.data!);
              return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
            },
          ),
        ),
        routes: [
          GoRoute(
            path: 'family/:fid',
            pageBuilder: (context, state) => NoTransitionPage<void>(
              key: state.pageKey,
              child: FutureBuilder<Family>(
                future: repo.getFamily(state.params['fid']!),
                pageBuilder: (context, snapshot) {
                  if (snapshot.hasError)
                    return ErrorPage(snapshot.error as Exception?);
                  if (snapshot.hasData)
                    return FamilyPage(family: snapshot.data!);
                  return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
                },
              ),
            ),
            routes: [
              GoRoute(
                path: 'person/:pid',
                pageBuilder: (context, state) => NoTransitionPage<void>(
                  key: state.pageKey,
                  child: FutureBuilder<FamilyPerson>(
                    future: repo.getPerson(
                      state.params['fid']!,
                      state.params['pid']!,
                    ),
                    pageBuilder: (context, snapshot) {
                      if (snapshot.hasError)
                        return ErrorPage(snapshot.error as Exception?);
                      if (snapshot.hasData)
                        return PersonPage(
                            family: snapshot.data!.family,
                            person: snapshot.data!.person);
                      return const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator());
                    },
                  ),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ],
    errorPageBuilder: (context, state) => MaterialPage<void>(
      key: state.pageKey,
      child: ErrorPage(state.error),
    ),
  );
}

class NoTransitionPage<T> extends CustomTransitionPage<T> {
  const NoTransitionPage({required Widget child, LocalKey? key})
      : super(transitionsBuilder: _transitionsBuilder, child: child, key: key);

  static Widget _transitionsBuilder(
          BuildContext context,
          Animation<double> animation,
          Animation<double> secondaryAnimation,
          Widget child) =>
      child;
}
```

This is a simple case that shows a circular progress indicator while the data is
being loaded and before the page is shown.

The way transitions work, the outgoing page is shown for a little while before
the incoming page is shown, which looks pretty terrible when your page is doing
nothing but showing a circular progress indicator. I admit that I took the
coward's way out and turned off the transitions so that things wouldn't look
so bad in the animated screenshot. However, it would be nicer to keep the
transition, navigate to the page showing as much as possible, e.g. the `AppBar`,
and then show the loading indicator inside the page itself. In that case, you'll
be on your own to show an error in the case that the data can't be loaded. Such
polish is left as an exercise for the reader.
